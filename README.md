# Project in Progress ðŸš§

**This project is currently in development.** Some features might not be complete or may be unstable.


This final project presents the development of a control device that allows the user
to operate machinery for which they have authorized access. It should be an affordable
and flexible option for different environments. Market studies have been conducted on this
product and its components. Additionally, the device includes the capability to record
usage time and electrical consumption on its own server, and future improvements such
as the processing of the recorded data are also considered.
